      <h3 class="blogpost1">Personality Traits according to the internet</h3>
      <p class="blogpost1">According to Big 5 I am very insociable scoring 25/100 in total extraversion and 12/100 in social specifically, which makes a lot of sense to me I struggle to read neurotypical social situations so I tend to avoid them, going through Extraversion I am a 25/100 in assertiveness, this is something I am trying to work on, but also makes a lot of sense to me as I described in the Autism section I have high levels of anxiety, my energy level comes in at the low end of average at 37/100.<br>
      <br>According to the agreeableness section I am above average in agreeableness, scoring 87/100 in compassion 62/100 in respectfulness and 75/100 in trust making the score for agreeableness 75/100.<br>      
      <br>My conscientiousness score gets a little stuff up by my ADHD, it comes out to 42/100 despite both productiveness and responsibility coming out at 62/100 the high end of average, this is because my organization comes in at 0, and this is because of a simple issue, I often don’t put things away I put them down, a common ADHD trick is don’t put it down put it away, because without thinking we will almost always put something down within 2 meters of where it belongs than not be able to find it when we need it, this is also not helped by something referred to as ADHD blindness, which as an example as most people seem to have a junk drawer, say I go into the junk drawer looking for batteries, I will see everything in that drawer except for the very visible to a neurotypical batteries, this makes organization very difficult, because now I’m moving things trying to find something that most people would see without issue.<br>
      <br>My negative emotionality comes in around the middle at 54/100, this is caused by high anxiety 75/100 low depression 25/100 and high end of average Emotional Volatility 62/100, this has all been somewhat described already so I do not feel any need to go into detail here.<br>
      <br>My Open-mindedness comes in above average, totaling 79/100 both Creative imagination and Intellectual Curiosity coming in at 75/100 and Aesthetic sensitivity coming in at 87/100 this makes a lot of sense to me, I am always open to at least hear someone out and I am always eager to learn, however this does not mean I’ll take you at your word completely, I will look into it further and think it over because that is the logical way to go about learning new things.<br>
      <br>By looking at this I believe the biggest impact to my study will be the Open mindedness section as this describes my willingness to learn, the Dev academy website asks me to describe an ethical situation which I believe means that they want me to describe a hard decision which I have faced many, I had to choose between my happiness and my life, and my biological family, when I came out as queer, that was a hard choice but ultimately I had to choose the option that didn’t end in me no longer being a part of this planet. Was this a decision based on ethics I don’t know, but it was a thing of do I deal with their bogus values or me being able to live my own life, which is a hard call for anyone, a lot of people have influenced my life, but the most memorable thing I can remember was when my 90 Y/O great grandmother turned around and said, “You’ve got to look after yourself, I may not understand it but you need to do whatever you need to for yourself to be happy.” My Adhd and autism will definitely have some impact on my learning, and has definitely made jobs that I’ve done in the past hard, but this is why I’m doing this course so I can get jobs that I know I am capable of. Pretty much every time I’ve had to work with others there’s been tension, there’s always someone who doesn’t want to do their part, and I can’t actually remember how we resolved any of these off the top of my head. I mean a lot of the time I’d either end up doing all the work myself, or turn around and go well if you don’t care I don’t care, I do not recommend doing either of these. Working out the best way to deal with situations like these is another reason I am taking this course<br></p>
