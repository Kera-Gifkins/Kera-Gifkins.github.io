      <h3 class="blogpost1">Learning plan</h3>
      <p class="blogpost1">My long term goal at this moment, is to finish this course after that is is to get a halfway decent well paying job in tech, as with my disabilities I cannot work in most industries.
      <br>My strengths when it comes to learning at least in the case of dev acadamy is that this is a topic I am interested in. my potential limitations are my disabilities and mental health, however I do not believe this will cause any issues otherwise I would have delayed doing this course.
      <br>Reading this question slightly confused me, however I guess something non tech or human skills related I would like to pick up from this course is a litte bit more patience as sometimes I can lack in that.
      <br>I find when things are starting to get to me sometimes the best response is to step back, that is unless what is getting to me is a limitation of my skills, and in which case I will ask for assistance from both my classmates and my facilitators, and how I will work safely with other people during this course is with breathing excerises and stretches when getting tense.
      <br>If something has me completely stuck for more than 10 minutes I will google it, if I can not find the answer to my problem within a further 5 minutes I will than send a message in the discord asking for help.
      <br>I expect the facilitation team to understand that we are all still learning and may find this difficult, other than that I expect professionalism, which basically means I expect that you will see us as another human being and treat us with respect and dignity.
      <br>The only guarentied block-out time I have right now is that I will not be able to do pretty much anything on the 19th of April as I have a dentist appointment that day, and the dentist tends to wipe me out for the rest of the day.</p>

      <h3 class="blogpost1">Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p class="blogpost1">Neuroplasticity is the knowledge that both psyically doing something and mentally doing something can improve your ability to do it, it is the power of the imagionation, for example if you imagion yourself doing a yoga stretch it engages the same muscles as actually doing the yoga stretch.
        <br>I have already been using these princibles for the last about 8 months, as my personal trainer taught it to me when I was sick and unable to do the actual moving around, so instead they got me to sit in a meditation way and imagion myself doing the movements, and since than it has been something I have done probably daily, it gives the benefit of doing an activity and really lets you improve your knowledge, for example with coding when I am doing it solely mentally, I pick up when there is a gap in my knowledge, and than I have to go to physically because now I know I need to do some research.
        <br>One way to increase neuroplasticity is to practice both psyically and mentally, but another is mind games like sudoku, puzzles, spot the differences and crosswords, of course this is not everything, however really anything that gets you thinking helps your neuroplasticity, for example a kid trying to work out how to do a build in minecraft is helping they're neuroplasticity.
        <br>I actually did very little research on this I watched the video linked on this sprint, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ngs5_WXxfo, but otherwise I used alot of previous knowledge to write this, so given that and that my personal trainer really helped me learn how to do this properly I'm going to put here the link to her tik tok, even though this has very little talking about this topic specifically, as that is who I learnt the beginning of this off and set me off on learning more. https://www.tiktok.com/@el_banani2.0 warning for people sensitive to swearing, this may not be the best place for you.

      <h3 class="blogpost1">Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p class="blogpost1">Growth mindset is something I learnt just before starting this course, so first I'm going to describe fixed mindset and than growth so we can compare the two, fixed mindset is saying I do not know how to play the guitar, or I don't know how to write this line of code, which leaves little to no room for growth, however growth mindset is as simple as adding the word yet to the end of the end of these phrases, I don't know how to play the guitar yet, changes your brain from a pass fail mindset to a mindset of I can do this but I need to do a little more work to get there.
        <br>this exploration has really surprised me, as it's not only in learning this helps, for example a simple phrase like "I don't have the energy to do the dishes." Can and will set someone who's already in a negative headspace to spiral down further, however, "I don't have the energy to do the dishes yet, I may later." Puts a little bit of optism into your mind, and isn't an unrealistic statement, maybe you just need a short rest and to not put so much presure on yourself.
        <br>I have been using growth mindset throughout this entire course with statements like "I haven't got this yet." "I can't quite work this out right now." More often than not this leads to me working it out, and sometimes the best thing I can do is walk away think it over and come back to it.

      <h3 class="blogpost1">Te Whare Tapa WhƒÅ</h3>
      <p class="blogpost1">Well it may not have been called something else, I can not say for sure, when I was in high school I was taught this, and it was very helpful, however we were also taught about when the walls collide but before I get into that let's talk about how I understand each wall, and what I do for each wall. (Which some will have overlap.)
        <br>Taha Tinana, which I always remember as the psyical, or the body, this is affected by everything that you do with your physical being, for example sitting on the couch watching tv 6 hours a day, going to work at an office job 8 hours a day, playing video games on a computer, 6 hours a day and sleeping only 4 hours every day, is going to put massive holes in this wall and serverly decrease the overall structure of your Hauora, your wellbeing, however working in an office job, eating somewhat healthy (noones perfect we all eat unhealthy things occassionally) sleeping 6-9 hours a day and doing half an hour possibly more of fitness a day, will drastically increase your psysical wellbeing. Personally for me this looks like training with my personal trainer for an hour 3 times a week, eating a decent amount of protein and vegetables, and this one doesn't always work out as I have sleeping disorders, however I make sure I'm in bed by 10 (knowing I won't get to sleep until at least 11 30) and try to always be awake by 8am.
        <br> Taha Hinengaro, which is all about the emotional and mental wellbeing, this for me is all about knowing my limitations, if I'm getting stressed looking at code, I need to walk away for at least 5 minutes, go outside take a breather and come back with a fresh headspace, it also means preparing, and being mentally ready for my tasks.
        <br>Taha Wairua, this is normally referred to as spiritual, but I was taught it has more to do with your surroundings, the feeling of the area you are in, which makes alot more sense to me, as a supermarket has a very different feeling to an empty field, it's alot about the feeling you get off the area around you, which means putting myself in the right enviroment to focus on the task at hand, as a good example if I was sitting here right now and I could hear gunfire across the road, I am not going to feel safe and thus not going to be able to concentrate on my study, this is an extreme example to get the point accross perfectly, and using this example I can say that I wouldn't feel safe even days after, but to use a similar example if I lived next to a military base and heard them using fire arms this isn't going to impact me as much if at all because I know that it is being used safely, I do not currently live anywhere near a military base, so if I hear gunfire theres no guarentee a stray bullet wouldn't come through my window, it's all about the feeling the enviroment gives you.
        <br>Taha Whanau, this is talking about family wellbeing, but that is not a good translation, whanau in traditional Maori more refers to the company you keep, that neighbour that you go deliver some of your freshly harvested strawberries to because she's a lovely old lady and you want her to know you care, she is a part of your whenua, even though she may not be a part of your whakapapa or your line of ancestors, so know that I've clarified this I can talk about my very untraditional whanau, I have a small whanau and we all help each other where we can, my flatmate Nathan who we will check in on each other and make sure we're taking care of the other 3 walls, my cousin Keiko and their husband, my two furbabies Emmy and Jupiter, photos of which are all over this website, and the key to this is we all help each other out where we can.
        <br>Whenua, the land, this one is really important, I do yoga listening to nature regularly because it brings peace, when I have time, I goto my special spot near the river that I grew up next to, it brings calm and keeps everything else in check, it is the foundation to all these walls.
        <br>Now I would like to talk about when the walls collide, this sounds weird but walls colliding can look like alot of things, for example eating your feelings, can be good for your mental health but you are throwing bullets at your psyical health, and let's be completely honest it's a tempory fix to your mental health as well, because afterwards you're going to be mad at yourself for eating an entire cheesecake, or the opposite, eating nothing at all that has flavour because you don't deserve the flavour, this will impact your feelings on your enviroment, or your spiritual wellbeing, had an arguement with your whanau that hasn't been resolved, that's causing you to be emoitonal and not eat, now your impacting all of the walls at once, and this is where it's important to know how to deal with situations, if one wall is crumbling you do not want to take it out on any of the other 3 walls, because that will lead to the roof collapsing, and that is the worst thing that can happen, because now you feel like crap in every possible way, you've left a mess everywhere impacting your enviroment, you're beating yourself up and taking it out on the whanau, and your not looking after your body, fix the cracks as they happen, yoga is great for 3 of the 4 walls, everything but whanau, do it outside and your working in nature, this will cause a calming effect as a long as that is your goal, and than you can go have a calm conversation with that member of your whanau that you had an arguement with and come to an agreement that works for both of you.
        <br>The part I have dipped into but not properly discussed, the 4 walls hold up the roof, and the roof is you, all of you, and the walls being in decent shape means that you can do everything you need to, and because of this what you need to do to help those 4 walls looks different for everyone, for example I may need medication to help my psyical wall due to some psyical condition, but all someone else might need is to eat right daily and do 15 minutes of excerise 3 times a week, this is for you to work out. I do training 3 times a week for about an hour and do smaller personal excercises every day I don't, I have dinner with my flatmate most nights, I talk to my cousin at least 3 times a week, I do yoga often outdoors regularly, to help with my emotional and mental awareness, and of course I try to keep my enviroment workable and my workable will look different to yours. The key is this is all about you.
