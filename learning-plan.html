      <h3 id="blogpost1">Learning plan</h3>
      <p id="blogpost1">My long term goal at this moment, is to finish this course after that is is to get a halfway decent well paying job in tech, as with my disabilities I cannot work in most industries</p>
      <p id="blogpost1">My strengths when it comes to learning at least in the case of dev acadamy is that this is a topic I am interested in. my potential limitations are my disabilities and mental health, however I do not believe this will cause any issues otherwise I would have delayed doing this course</p>
      <p id="blogpost1">Reading this question slightly confused me, however I guess something non tech or human skills related I would like to pick up from this course is a litte bit more patience as sometimes I can lack in that.</p>
      <p id="blogpost1">I find when things are starting to get to me sometimes the best response is to step back, that is unless what is getting to me is a limitation of my skills, and in which case I will ask for assistance from both my classmates and my facilitators, and how I will work safely with other people during this course is with breathing excerises and stretches when getting tense.</p>
      <p id="blogpost1">if something has me completely stuck for more than 10 minutes I will google it, if I can not find the answer to my problem within a further 5 minutes I will than send a message in the discord asking for help.</p>
      <p id="blogpost1">I expect the facilitation team to understand that we are all still learning and may find this difficult, other than that I expect professionalism, which basically means I expect that you will see us as another human being and treat us with respect and dignity.</p>
      <p id="blogpost1">The only guarentied block-out time I have right now is that I will not be able to do pretty much anything on the 19th of April as I have a dentist appointment that day, and the dentist tends to wipe me out for the rest of the day.</p>
