        <p id="blogpost1">I know some of you will be looking at this and going, it looks like a unicorn threw up on the page, however I know alot of dylexics struggle to read black on a white backgound or white on a black background, so I avoided this by using a coloured background for everything, and if I have not done so already I will also be looking into dyslexic friendly fonts and adding these to the page also. I also used soft colours to convey that this is a safe place.</p>
