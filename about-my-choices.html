      <h3 class="blogpost1">Colours</h3>
        <p class="blogpost1">I know some of you will be looking at this and going, it looks like a unicorn threw up on the page, however I know alot of dylexics struggle to read black on a white backgound or white on a black background, so I avoided this by using a coloured background for everything, and if I have not done so already I will also be looking into dyslexic friendly fonts and adding these to the page also. I also used soft colours to convey that this is a safe place.</p>
      <h3 class="blogpost1">Font size</h3>
        <p class="blogpost1">I choose my font sizes to reflect what I read online works better for people with reading inparments, adding 4 to the numbers just to make absolute sure. than making each heading bigger than whatever it is relating to for example the heading above this is 24px but this paragraph is 20px, and Choices and clarification is 28px, just so it is obvious what relates to what.</p>
