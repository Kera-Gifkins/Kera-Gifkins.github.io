      <h3 class="blogpost1">Problem, Superfizzbuzz</h3>
        <p class="blogpost1">honestly even after getting through this, this challenge can goto hell, I just could not work this out, I tried googling, I tried asking for help, I tried almost everything and just nothing was sinking in, I think I was stuck on this for about 15 hours of coding time where some it it was spent on future challenges, as I was just too stuck for this, when finally it all hit me at like 1am in bed and I rushed to solve this challenge, And now as typing this I know what I did, but I have lost the understanding of how it worked. <p>
      <h3 class="blogpost1">Problem, Variables and objects</h3>
        <p class="blogpost1">I am choosing this one as this simply came down to missing a link, I didn't understand what to do asked in the discord if I was missing something and immediately people answered about a video, that I hadn't seen so I asked where it was got the answer, and than this challange was easy.</p>
        <h3 class='blogpost1'>Problem solving techniques</h3>
        <p class="blogpost1">I found Pseudo code really helpful, expecially in remembering what I'm still trying to do. 
          <br>I would also try so many things throughout this weeks sprint and I feel like often I would try something it would be worse than before I did and I'd roll it back to where I was before. 
          <br>As for using the rubber ducky method I spoke to enough random objects throughout this sprint that I'm pretty sure my neighbours think I'm completely nuts, pretty sure I spoke to the toilet roll well I was in the bathroom at one point because I was just trying to work things out. 
          <br>I read every error message, however when I had really messed up these were not helpful. 
          <br>I did not do as much console logging as I should have in this challenge mostly because I do not fully understand how to read a console log in vs code.
          <br>When I have been struggling for a little bit I always goto google, this applies in and outside of this course, the bigger problem this week was knowing what I needed to goolgle.
          <br>After Google my next response is to ask the discord server, which includes my peers and my coaches, which as described earier my bigger problem this week was if things would actuall sink in.
          <br>Even on reflection I do not think I could have done anything different this week, unfortunately my brain was the issue this week and the only thing I could have changed is not going to my dentist appointment, however that was absolutely essential so the only thing I think I would like to change in future is that I would like things to sink in quicker.</p>
        <h3 class="blogpost1">Reluctance to ask for help</h3>
        <p class="blogpost1">This week I was very reluctant to ask for help with Superfizzbuzz, mostly because I had already asked 3 times, so because I knew things weren't sinking in I was reluctant to ask for further help, however I still did, and eventually I got there.</p>
